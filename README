These are some data files and the corresponding index to be used with
the quiz command from bsd-games.

I use them as a flashcard kind of application for practising german
vocabulary, etc.

To run them just call the quiz command with -i parameter. The index
uses relative paths, so you should be in the directory for it to work.
